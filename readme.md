### Laravel app boilerplate with email verification on registration

Every time we at [LUBUS](http://www.lubus.in) start a laravel project , we need to re-implement this process of adding email verification in the project every time , so created this boilerplate out of personal needs. How we achieved this can be read [here at our blog](http://www.lubus.in/blog/adding-email-verification-in-laravel-5-3-app-149)

### Installation

 - Clone the repo using `git clone https://github.com/lubusIN/laravel-email-verification-app-boilerplate.git myApp`
 - `cd myApp`
 - Run `composer install`
 - If you already have a fresh install of laravel, make sure to run `php artisan make:auth` at the start
 - Create the `.env` file from `.env.example` file & configure the following: App key, Database credentials, Mail driver
 - Run `php artisan key:generate`
 - Run `php artisan migrate`
 - That's it , you are done!
